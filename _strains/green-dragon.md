**VIBES:** in a coastal cave like a hidden temple, an ancient jade dragon named Thang perches upon his pile of gems

**Euphoric - Powerful - Sparkling**

Flagship, special variety.

The Dragon variety of kratom is kind of our Thang thang– a personal favorite of ours, quite uncommon to see for sale in the West. The extremely strong and well-balanced profile of Green Dragon, dried indoors following traditional methods to preserve potency, truly can't be beat. This alkaloid-rich Mitragyna sp. varietal originally sourced from Thailand.
