**Potent - Balanced - Popular**

Premium classic green blended for potency.

Hailing from Thailand, this famous variety is not so much a botanical strain as it is Thai slang for a premium grade of kratom. Much like the city of Bangkok, Green Maeng Da is a super potent blend of kratoms from the surrounding regions. Each supplier's Maeng Da will be blended differently from the next, and we think that our guy's blend is the best of the best. This powder consists of many of our farmer's most high-potency strains, blended for optimum balance and pleasure.
