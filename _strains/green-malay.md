A longstanding customer favorite, Green Malay originates in the jungles of Northern Borneo in the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak. The area is a premier hotspot for ecotourism due to its vibrant biodiversity and the local variety of Mitragyna sp. is known for its exceptionally alkaloid-rich profile. Often described as euphoric, Green Malay offers well-balanced and versatile effects.
