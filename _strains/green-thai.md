**Gentle - Fortifying - Energetic**

Traditional green variety.

Traditionally chewed as a quid or prepared as tea by the local people, the Thai prize kratom for its performance enhancing effects, medicinal benefits, and as a form of hospitality. Green Thai provides relief from pain and fatigue to get you through your toughest day.
