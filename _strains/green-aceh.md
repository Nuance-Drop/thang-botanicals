**VIBES:** a critically endangered Sumatran tiger pads swiftly through the vibrant understory of an ancient jungle

**Intense - Raw - Vital**

Legendary variety, exceedingly rare. 

Not a strain you're likely to find elsewhere besides the wishlist of the nerdiest of kratom connoisseurs. This is a local variety indigenous to the autonomous Aceh region of western Sumatra in the beautiful archipelago of Indonesia. Aceh's dense rainforest cradles the greatest biodiversity in all of Pacific Asia. Our Green Aceh kratom is quite possibly the most powerful strain of Mitragyna speciosa on earth and possesses extremely potent narcotic properties.
