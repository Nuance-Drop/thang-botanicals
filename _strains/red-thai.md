**VIBES:** a saffron-robed monk walks slowly through morning mist, each step deliberate and grounded

**Traditional - Smooth - Reliable**

Traditional red for pain relief and relaxation.

The classic Thai red profile—slow, smooth, and grounding. This strain creeps up gently but provides substantial relief. Suitable for both daytime pain management (in lower doses) and evening relaxation.
