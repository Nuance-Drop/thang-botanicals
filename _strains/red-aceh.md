Legendary red variety, super rare.

Not a strain you're likely to find elsewhere besides the wishlist of the nerdiest of kratom connoisseurs. This is a local variety indigenous to the autonomous Aceh region of western Sumatra in the beautiful archipelago of Indonesia. Aceh's dense rainforest cradles the greatest biodiversity in all of Pacific Asia. A fermented version of the Aceh strain, Red Aceh is perfect for nighttime use and heavy pain relief with powerful opiate-like effects.
