**VIBES:** from his bamboo porch, a hardworking father overlooks a misty plantation with a steaming morning cuppa and a hand-rolled cigarette

**Energetic - Smooth - Inspiring**

Our farmer's personal favorite strain.

Another blend formulated for optimum strength, but this time also for smoothness. The effects of Super Green can be compared to a strong cup of coffee. In fact, our farmer likes to prepare his in an old school pour-over coffee maker and drink in the morning to motivate his intensive work days on the plantation.
